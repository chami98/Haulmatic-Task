The project is deployed and accessible at [https://haulmatic-task.web.app/](https://haulmatic-task.web.app/).


## Front End (React)

The Front End part of the project is implemented using React.js with Redux for state management. It includes:

- Login page and Home page with React Router for navigation
- User authentication with Redux
- User management module allowing creation, updating, and deletion of users
- Unit tests for create and update processes

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `client` directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.

## Back End (Node.js)

The Back End part of the project is developed using Node.js, creating REST APIs for user management. It includes:

- RESTful APIs for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving users
- Implementation of authentication and authorization
- Data storage using data structures
